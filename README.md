# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component

### The challenge
To build out this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## My process
Given the content I applied HTML5 with class names. I created a style guide with the :root incase a client wanted the theme changed. This was I would not have to change the multiple fonts and colors. Since it is easier to do mobile first with how the layout is in a straight column I just had to do one media query for desktop and tablet. There was no distinction between desktop and tablet. Once I had the layout formed I went to make sure all the margins, padding, and flow were done according to the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first


### What I learned

The learning process was basically me reusing my knowledge of basic CSS and placement. I do projects at least once a day to keep my mind focused on Frontend Development. I use flex for different layouts

```
.card__price {
    width: 70%;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around;
    align-items: center;
    margin: 1.5em 0;
}

```
This code allowed me to make the pricing work together and aligned centered with space.


### Continued development

I would like to understand and utilize grid to make the layout even more interactive. Right now I just have things lined next to one another but using grid would allow the object to move more fluidly.
